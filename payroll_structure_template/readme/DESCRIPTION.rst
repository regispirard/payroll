The Payroll Structure Template module is an extension to the OCA Payroll module designed to simplify the deployment and maintenance of standardized payroll structures across multiple companies.
With evolving payroll legislation, the module offers an efficient way to adapt and manage payroll localizations, ensuring that companies stay compliant.

Aiming for both flexibility and control, this module enables:

* Simplified deployment of a standard payroll structure (aka template), with country-specific rules, categories, and contribution registers

* Enables the definition and maintenance of payroll structures and rules within the data files

* Ensured update of rules according to changes in the template for an easy adaptation to payroll legislation changes

* Adpated to multi-company projects by enabling selective deployment and maintenance of salary structures in relevant companies.

By adding Payroll Structure Template as a dependency to any payroll localization module, developers can define a country-specific salary structure template directly in the localization module's data files. 

Note : custom rules and categories can be added manually to the deployed structure when needed, and these will remain unchanged after update of the template.
